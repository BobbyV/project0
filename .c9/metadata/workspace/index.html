In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>","","<h3>","<a name=\"authors-and-contributors\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#authors-and-contributors\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>","","<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/821\" class=\"user-mention\">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
